# Simon-Game

Play the classic Simon Game in this website: https://unm07.github.io/Simon-Game/

Rules:
1) Turn on the Simon game by pressing any key
2) The game will start with a sequence of lights and sounds. Pay close attention to the sequence, as you will need to repeat it later.
3) After the sequence is complete, the game will wait for you to repeat it. To do so, press the corresponding colored buttons in the same order as the sequence.
4) If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will play a longer sequence with an additional color added. If you make a mistake, the game will buzz and end the round.
5) Continue playing and repeating the sequences correctly to progress to higher levels.
6) The game will continue until you make a mistake, at which point it will end and display your score.
7) That's all there is to it! Good luck and have fun!
